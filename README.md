## Pizza Hut Sales Analysis Project üçïüìä

Welcome to the Pizza Hut Sales Analysis project! This repository contains an SQL-based analysis of sales data from Pizza Hut stores. The goal is to explore and derive insights from the data to better understand sales trends, customer preferences, and store performance.

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL to uncover meaningful insights. Below is a breakdown of the key steps involved:

**1. Data Collection**
‚Ä¢	The raw sales data was sourced from various channels, including databases, CSV files, or other storage systems. The dataset includes details such as customer orders, product information, order dates, and transaction amounts.

**2. Data Preparation and Transformation****
‚Ä¢	Using SQL, the raw data was cleaned, filtered, and transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis. Key tasks included:
o	Joining multiple tables to consolidate relevant information.
o	Handling missing or inconsistent data.
o	Creating calculated fields (e.g., total order value, discounts, etc.).
o	Aggregating data for summary statistics.

**3. Data Analysis**
‚Ä¢	SQL queries were written to perform a comprehensive analysis of the data. Key areas of exploration include:
o	Top-Selling Pizzas: Identifying the most popular pizza flavors and categories.
o	Sales Trends: Analyzing sales patterns over time (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly).
o	Customer Insights: Evaluating customer demographics, preferences, and ordering behavior.
o	Order Metrics: Calculating average order values, total revenue, and other key performance indicators.
o	Store Performance: Assessing the performance of individual Pizza Hut locations to identify high-performing and underperforming stores.
5. Insights and Visualizations
   
‚Ä¢	The results of the SQL analysis were used to generate actionable insights. These insights can be visualized using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) for better interpretation.

**Key Features of the Project**
‚Ä¢	SQL Queries: The repository includes well-documented SQL scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
‚Ä¢	Insights: Detailed findings on sales trends, customer behavior, and store performance.
‚Ä¢	Scalability: The project can be extended to include additional datasets or more complex analyses.

**How to Use This Repository**
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.	Set up your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any SQL-compatible database).
3.	Load the provided dataset into your database.
4.	Run the SQL scripts to perform the analysis.
5.	Explore the insights and customize the queries as needed.

**Future Enhancements**
‚Ä¢	Integrate with a BI tool for interactive dashboards.
‚Ä¢	Incorporate machine learning models to predict sales trends.
‚Ä¢	Expand the dataset to include more variables, such as marketing campaigns or seasonal effects.
